```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Some MacOS apps such as "Pulse Secure Client" may not have an option to disable "Start at login". If you experience such cases, you can use the trick [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43555960).

The **apps** folder in this repo contains my favorite *"I don't want you at startup apps"*. Add them to your "Login Items" and have a nice day ;)
